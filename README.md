# Tic-Tac-Toe with GUI

Simple tic-tic-toe game with GUI interface, that was written by Swing Framework.

I wrote this game with tutorial on YouTube, however the result was too simple for me and i added some new things like simple enemy bot and stastic button.

P.s. I learn Java already 24 days, i think that's a good result
